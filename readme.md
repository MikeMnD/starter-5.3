# Laravel project starter (forked from 5.3.16)

This starter is very basic and handles a few of the basic steps for configuring an Administr powered project.

It installs:
* [administrcms/administr](https://github.com/administrcms/administr)
* [barryvdh/laravel-debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)
* [barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper)
